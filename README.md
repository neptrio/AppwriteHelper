# AppwriteHelper

Library for using Appwrite in C# projects.

# Notice

This package is under active development and should be used with caution, as significant changes may occur.

Installation NuGet:

PM > Install-Package AppwriteHelper
```

Usage:
```csharp
```

# Compatibility

Version 1.7.x follows the Appwrite Server versioning scheme and is compatible with the corresponding Appwrite Server release. A drawback of following Appwrite’s versioning is that breaking changes are not immediately obvious when using semantic versioning. The patch version number does not follow Appwrite’s versioning.

# Development

Development takes place on the main branch. Changes are selectively cherry-picked into the 1.8.x and 1.7.x maintenance branches.
